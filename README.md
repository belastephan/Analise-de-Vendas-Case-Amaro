## Status Project

Completed

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to think as a Data Analyst for a data-driven company, where one of the goals of the company is to maximize revenue, how to increase that (revenue) through decreasing bank slip cancelation rate.

## Steps

The project was set up by using PYTHON. The files were read in a ".db" format and then converted to a ".cvs" format to be developed in TABLEAU. 

It was necessary to realize some adjustments in the type of the variables and also carry out the settings concerning the tables. 

After having collected all data, it was done an overview with the main kpis (order quantity, revenue, GMV etc) and worked on identifying patterns among the most important variables (days of the week, cupons, categories, State, ages, type of devices).

## Conclusion

Some patterns were identified for the increase of the revenue through the reduction of the bank slip's purchase: 

- Being mainly performed in SÃ£o Paulo.
- Developing campaings to encourage purchase on credit cards on the weekends (discounts, gifts, free delivery service etc).
- Sending a bank slip code through whatsapp to increase this type of payment. 
- Sending whatsapp/email messages to remember the bank slip's expiration date.
- Being able to modify the shopping cart even if the bank slip has been issued in order to reduce the cancelations and the database duplicity.

For the next steps, it's interesting to deep dive in an exploration analysis using decision tree model.
